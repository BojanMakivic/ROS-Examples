- p. 11, the summary of the treatment-control comparison says "the treated units were 4.8 points higher than the controls, \bar{y} = 31.7 under the treatment and \bar{y} = 25.5 for the controls." The difference in shown means is 6.2 and not 4.8.  Not that these values change when rerunning the simulation. (thanks Desislava Petkova) 
- p. 39, in the second sentence of the first full paragraph, "Figure 3.4 displays data on log metabolic rate vs. body mass indicating..." should be "log metabolic rate vs. log body mass" (thanks Ravi Shroff)
- p. 42, the last line, in "Linear transformations" section "Exercise 3.5" should be "Exercise 3.6". (thanks Ed Berry)
- p. 54, in "Comparisons, visual and numerical" subsection, "Figure 4.2" in the first sentence should be "Figure 4.3." (thanks Ravi Shroff)
- p. 55 `se_weighted_avg <- sqrt(sum(W*se)^2)` should be `se_weighted_avg <- sqrt(sum((W*se)^2))` (thanks to Desislava Petkova)
- p. 288, Chapter 15 Bibliographic note is missing the reference to the RiskyBehavior data: "The HIV risk data (RiskyBehavior) used in exercises comes fromcomes from El-Bassel et al (2003)."
