## 1st (2020) printing

- p. 11, the summary of the treatment-control comparison says "the treated units were 4.8 points higher than the controls, \bar{y} = 31.7 under the treatment and \bar{y} = 25.5 for the controls." The difference in shown means is 6.2 and not 4.8.  Not that these values change when rerunning the simulation. (thanks Desislava Petkova) 
- p. 39, in the second sentence of the first full paragraph, "Figure 3.4 displays data on log metabolic rate vs. body mass indicating..." should be "log metabolic rate vs. log body mass" (thanks Ravi Shroff)
- p. 42, the last line, in "Linear transformations" section "Exercise 3.5" should be "Exercise 3.6". (thanks Ed Berry)
- p. 54, in "Comparisons, visual and numerical" subsection, "Figure 4.2" in the first sentence should be "Figure 4.3." (thanks Ravi Shroff)
- p. 55 `se_weighted_avg <- sqrt(sum(W*se)^2)` should be `se_weighted_avg <- sqrt(sum((W*se)^2))` (thanks to Desislava Petkova)
- p. 143 the correct values for mean and sd in the last column of Figure 10.7 are 260.1 and 2.5 (thanks to Eam O'Brien)
- p. 143 3rd line from bottom the correct values for mean and sd mentioned in the text are 260.1 and 2.5 (thanks to Eam O'Brien)
- p. 159 "as in Figure 11.2" -> "as in Figure 11.3" (thanks to Eam O'Brien)
- p. 174 "and so the log score is  $-\frac{1}{2}\log\sigma$" should be "and so the log score is  $-\log\sigma$" (thanks to Matěj Grabovsky)
- p. 288, Chapter 15 Bibliographic note is missing the reference to the RiskyBehavior data: "The HIV risk data (RiskyBehavior) used in exercises comes fromcomes from El-Bassel et al (2003)." Full reference: El-Bassel, N., Witte, S. S., Gilbert, L., Wu, E., Chang, M., Hill, J., and Steinglass, P. (2003).

- p. 314 Following Equation (17.1) "... did not include enough Republicans." -> "... included too many Democrats." (thanks to misterblister)
- p. 316, Figure 17.2 the values in the column $N_j/N$ should be $0.16, 0.17, 0.19, 0.17, 0.16, 0.15$ as in the code on the same page. (thanks to Noah Silbert)
